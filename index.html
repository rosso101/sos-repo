Behind each statistic lies a heartbreaking tale of shattered dreams and stolen futures. From the bustling metropolis to the remote corners of our nation, no woman is immune to the threat of violence that looms ominously overhead.</p>

<p><h2 class="MILA">Femicide is a really serious issue that affects women in so many ways.<br/> It's heartbreaking to think that it can even come from people close to us,<br/>like our dads. Femicide not only takes away precious lives, but it also creates<br/> fear and insecurity for women everywhere. It's important for us to <br/>raise awareness, support victims, and work towards a world where women can<br/> feel safe and empowered. Stay strong and let's keep fighting for a better future.</h2></p>

<p><h2 class="RUTH"> is a deeply concerning issue that affects women in Kenya. It is the intentional<br/> killing of women based on their gender. It's a sad reality that women face<br/> the threat of violence and discrimination simply because of their gender. As a woman,<br/>the issue of femicide has left a profound impact on my safety and<br/> well being.I'm happy to be a woman and that should not be a death sentence for me.
